# CodeClause_blindness-detection
using deep learning techniques to analyze retinal images and identify early signs of blindness. By detecting these signs early, we hope to enable early intervention and prevent irreversible vision loss. Our project utilizes cutting-edge technology and is built on a  foundation of collaboration between medical professionals and data scientists.
